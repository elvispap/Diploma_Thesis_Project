Our system collects data and produces information about the research activity of the University of Thessaly. All this data is collected in an automatic way in real time through web crawling from Scopus, Microsoft Academic Search and IEEE Xplore. Then, having this data, our system produces valuable information and research metrics that represent the University's activity using data visualization techniques.
Finally,the system was developed with Django, Python and other web technologies and libraries.
